[features]
	# "OFF": Disables the zoom's cinematic camera.
	# "VANILLA": Uses the game's cinematic camera while zooming.
	# "MULTIPLIED": Uses the cinematic camera with a configurable multiplier while zooming.
	# options: OFF, VANILLA, MULTIPLIED
	# default: OFF
	cinematic_camera = "OFF"
	# Divides the mouse sensitivity with the zoom divisor while zooming.
	# default: true
	reduce_sensitivity = true
	# "OFF": The zoom will abruptly transition between its on and off states.
	# "SMOOTH": The zoom will smoothly transition between its on and off states in a manner resembling the game's FOV transitions.
	# "LINEAR": The zoom will linearly transition between its on and off states.
	# options: OFF, SMOOTH, LINEAR
	# default: SMOOTH
	zoom_transition = "SMOOTH"
	# "HOLD": The zoom will require the zoom key to be held.
	# "TOGGLE": The zoom will be toggled by the zoom key.
	# "PERSISTENT": The zoom will always be enabled, with the zoom key being used for zoom scrolling.
	# options: HOLD, TOGGLE, PERSISTENT
	# default: HOLD
	zoom_mode = "HOLD"
	# Allows to increase or decrease the zoom by scrolling with the mouse wheel.

	# "OFF": Disables the zoom overlay.
	# "VIGNETTE": Uses a vignette as the zoom overlay. The vignette texture can be found at assets/ok_zoomer/textures/misc/zoom_overlay.png
	# "SPYGLASS": Uses the spyglass overlay with the vignette texture. The spyglass texture can be used with the "Use Spyglass Texture" option.
	# options: OFF, VIGNETTE, SPYGLASS
	# default: OFF
	zoom_overlay = "OFF"
	# "OFF": Zooming won't require a spyglass and won't replace its zoom.
	# "REQUIRE_ITEM": Zooming will require a spyglass in order to work. This option is configurable through the ok_zoomer:zoom_dependencies item tag.
	# "REPLACE_ZOOM": Zooming will replace the spyglass zoom but it won't require one in order to work.
	# "BOTH": Zooming will act as a complete replacement of the spyglass zoom, requiring one to work and replacing its zoom as well.
	# options: OFF, REQUIRE_ITEM, REPLACE_ZOOM, BOTH
	# default: OFF
